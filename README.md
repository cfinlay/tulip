## Scaleable input gradient regularization for adversarial robustness

Code to reproduce the methods of the paper [Scaleable input gradient regularization for
adversarial robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11468). Included are:
* training scripts for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k
* scripts to evaluate trained models on test data (in particular, to calculate lower bounds on the minimum adversarial distance)
* scripts to download pretrained models used in the paper's results section
